## Project: Impact of Covid 19 on Home Prices/IT Jobs/Migration in USA. -- Step:3

## Introduction
  Covid 19 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic. 
Symptoms of COVIDâ€‘19 are variable, but often include fever,cough, headache,fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste. Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction). Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.
Due to COvid-19, many people working in the Information technology, started to work remotely (WFH - work from home). That directly effected the demand for home prices. I would like to address the consequences of the COVid 19 on information technology jobs and the demand for the migration, work from home and the affect on the increase and decrease of Housing prices.

    c. After applying filters, finalized the final data set in each area of analysis.

## Analysis.
  1. After finalizing the data from each of the areas, the final set of the data is stored in CVS format.
  2. From each set of data, required attributes are identified
  3. From the each set of data, applied the link between different data sets.
      eg: 1.how many new jobs are created in each state compared to previous year.
          2.which states have see highest number of job openings.
          3. Which states has see lowest growth in the jobs compared to the previous year.
