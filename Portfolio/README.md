### Projects

#### 1. Tesla Supercharing Stations Prediction
[Link](https://github.com/vjjampani/vjjampani/tree/main/Portfolio/Project-1)
Of all the various brands in the current market, Tesla is clearly the market leader not just because of the brand value and design but mostly because of the reliable Tesla supercharging stations. The public charging stations had their share of problems as they sometimes don’t work which is quite frustrating to the EV car owners. There are recent developments and collaboration between EV automakers to utilize Tesla supercharging stations which stand out to be the best and reliable ones so far with its large network. One of the key features for prospective EV car buyers is charging stations. I will be exploring more on this aspect where it might be useful for upcoming EV buyers to make purchase based on the charging stations and their possible expansion pattern/prediction and restricted to USA region.

#### 2. Predict & Approach Risk variables for Heart patients
[Link](https://github.com/vjjampani/vjjampani/tree/main/Portfolio/Project-2)
Cardiovascular Disease or heart disease, generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain or stroke. Other forms of heart conditions, such as those that affect heart's muscle, valves or rhythm. The purpose of this project is to predict the effects of different variables/parameters recorded in the data to predict patient mortality. By predicting so the physicians can determine high risk patients and can take better care of them thereby helping them survive and predicting the patients symptoms for a better treatment.

#### 3. WEATHER DATA PRESENATATION & VISUALIZATION
[Link](https://github.com/vjjampani/vjjampani/tree/main/Portfolio/Project-3)
Analysis and data visualizations of Weather data using various sources including kaggle dataset, API and others to analyze the Weather data and draw conclusions with visualizations/charts.

#### 4. Sentiment Analysis on iPhone Reviews(Amazon)
[Link](https://github.com/vjjampani/vjjampani/tree/main/Portfolio/Project-4)
I will be evaluating the overall response of cell phone reviews of previous models of the iPhone from the dataset sourced from the Kaggle website.
To be specific, this will be about iphone X/XE/XS/XR models. The objective is to solve the business problem of how to improve the quality of product further considering the customer reviews and help achieve better profits for the future products.

#### 5. Stroke Prediction based on risk factors
[Link](https://github.com/vjjampani/vjjampani/tree/main/Portfolio/Project-5)
Objective of this  project is to predict the certainty of a person to have this deadly disease based on various parameters such as age, gender, healthy habits, etc. so that this disease can be predicted before it becomes critical and be treated with normal measures and hopefully no lives are lost. 
From the vast pool of machine learning algorithms, I chose few methods to predict accurately.

#### 6. Air Travel Safety
[Link](https://github.com/vjjampani/vjjampani/tree/main/Portfolio/Project-6)
Travelling in airplane is making your life at risk. Air travel is risky compared to other modes of transportation. Likewise, there has been a lot of chatter in the media regarding the airline crashes and fatalities occurred in recent times. With several incidents in recent times, you might get an impression that these days, you are taking your life at stake by travelling in airplane instead of other modes of transportation like automobiles. Should you really worry to travel in airplane? Let’s look at the data before drawing a conclusion.

#### 7. Big Data Technologies : Hive NIFI and SOLR
[Link](https://github.com/vjjampani/vjjampani/tree/main/Portfolio/Project-7)
I am using an open API data and trying to ingest data from NIFI and publish the results from the NIFI API into a SOLR and finally loading the data into HIVE tables.

#### 8. Python : Weather Api data generation
[Link](https://github.com/vjjampani/vjjampani/tree/main/Portfolio/Project-8)
This is the first project created Python that uses a weather api and takes input as city or zip code to generate the weather details in different mertics.

### 9. Sentiment Analysis from X Data
[Link](https://github.com/vjjampani/vjjampani/tree/main/Portfolio/Project-9)
Natural Language Processing (NLP) plays a crucial role in sentiment analysis, which is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a body of text. This is particularly useful for understanding opinions, emotions, and attitudes expressed in various forms of communication, such as social media posts, product reviews, and customer feedback.

We will do so by following a sequence of steps needed to solve a general sentiment analysis problem. We will start with preprocessing and cleaning of the raw text of the tweets. Then we will explore the cleaned text and try to get some intuition about the context of the tweets. After that, we will extract numerical features from the data and finally use these feature sets to train models and identify the sentiments of the tweets.


#### 10.IPL (Indian Premier League) Match Predictive Analysis
[Link](https://github.com/vjjampani/vjjampani/tree/main/Portfolio/Project-10)

The Indian Premier League is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India. There are 10 franchises in the league representing different cities/state in India. IPL features many international and domestic players and usually happens between march and may every year. IPL (Indian Premier League) is the 2nd biggest sports league in the world next to NFL in USA.
IPL has only started in 2008 and it is already one of the fastest growing sports leagues in the world taking 2nd spot recently. The viewership and revenue have been in an uptrend too. Data Analytics has been a part of sports entertainment for a long time. As a sports enthusiast, I am curious to build a predictive analysis model to predict the winning team in an IPL match/tournament using various available stats available for all seasons (2008-2022).
